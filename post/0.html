          <b><h1> Summary</h1></b>
        From the <em>My Dinner with Andre</em> <a class = "link" href = " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Dinner_with_Andre">wikipedia</a> page<br>
        <p class = "demopara"><em><blockquote>
          My Dinner with Andre
        </em> is a 1981 American comedy-drama film directed by Louis Malle, and written by and starring André Gregory and Wallace Shawn as fictionalized versions of themselves sharing a conversation at Café des Artistes in Manhattan. The film's dialogue covers topics such as experimental theater, the nature of theater, and the nature of life, and contrasts Andre's spiritual experiences with Wally's modest humanism.</blockquote></p><br><br>
        <p class = "demopara"><em>My Dinner with Andre</em> is, essentially, a podcast. The movie starts with a monologue from Wally, where he describes his life as an actor and a playwright and also under what conditions he's meeting his friend, Andre. Andre is an eccentric and successful playwright, who had a mid-life crisis and traveled across Europe and Asia. He invites his close friend Wally to dinner to catch up with him and to of course describe his experiences and his philosophical views on the modern world. With this openness to such deep conversation, Wally too engages with his ideas and even presents his own worldview to Andre. The entirety of the movie focuses on this conversation, with the fancy restaurant serving as background noise, as a way to initially hook the audience and deeply invest themselves into the conversation. Throughout the movie, there are virtually no moving shots and the camera always stays focused on the two main characters: Wally and Andre.<br></p>
        <b><h1>Wally's Opening Monologue</h1></b>
        <p class = "demopara">The movie begins with a monologue from Wally, where he walks through the streets of New York with narration provided from the actor in the background. Wally describes his life and how he''s miserable due to a lack of fulfillment in his job as a playwright and actor. Due to the lack of activity in his career, he also is quite worried about his financial situation. He articulates his overall fearful & depressive mood throughout the monologue by juxtaposing it with his “aristocratic” lifestyle at the age of 10 and the fact that now he only thinks about money, instead of more meaningful things such as the arts or theater. The setting also adds to the audience''s first impression of Wally, due to the overall dampness and lack of bright light the audience slowly understands to what extent Wally''s life sucks. The most obvious use of the setting to articulate his overall sadness was when he goes from walking through the dimly lit streets of New York, whilst talking about his happier youthful days (“And all I thought about was art & music”), to, suddenly, a dark and scary subway tunnel as soon as he says, “Now I''m 36, and all I think about is money.” Now on the subway, Wally begins to talk about his old friend Andre, who was a great friend to him and a valued colleague (and successful) in the world of theater. He lists Andre's many theater related accomplishments, as to juxtapose and thus articulate how unexpected Andre''s recent change in demeanor has been. For example, Wally states that Andre has, recently, been babbling nonsense (for lack of a better word), such as asserting that he''s spoken with trees. Wally, drastically, changes his tone from one that was much more charitable to a more annoyed and anxious one that presupposes Andre''s mental insanity. Now at this point, Wally has walked to the restaurant at which he plans to dine & converse with Andre and soft & uplifting music starts to play and more bright light is shown on screen. This extensive use of the setting, lighting, music, and the tone of the actor who plays Wally is all to inform the audience of how Wally feels about the upcoming conversation. Wally is supposed to be a stand-in for the audience since the emotions he articulates are representative of their emotions, since who wouldn''t be afraid of meeting with an old friend that has supposedly gone insane? The setting, ultimately, serves to articulate Wally''s and thus the audience''s emotions. With this sentiment, the movie can use the changing of the setting, from that of a deathly and dimly lit New York to a lively and brightly lit upscale restaurant, to make the meetup with Andre much more meaningful. So, on top of making Wally representative of the audience, the monologue also serves to build up the overall tension and anxiety that naturally comes from such a situation which is then released when Wally (and thus the audience) meets a cheerful and relaxed Andre. Wally articulates this feeling of relief by cheerfully noting in his narration, “I remember when I first started working with Andre''s company; I couldn''t get over the way the actors would hug when they greeted each other. Wow, now I''m really in the theater!” In conclusion, the monologue serves to make Wally a representative of the audience and to also continuously layer feelings of anxiety over one another, until Wally''s (and thus the audience''s) initial interaction with Andre, which serves to put Wally and the audience at ease. This relief, which was increased tenfold by the tension built by the monologue, serves to increase the amount of emotional fulfillment the audience will eventually get from the rest of the conversation.<br></p>
        <b><h1>Thoughts</h1></b><br>
        <p class = "demopara"> <em>My Dinner with Andre</em>, in my eyes, is a <b>very</b> unique movie to me. It's one of the first movies I've ever watched that captivated me throughout its entire run. It felt like a podcast with two very different hosts but hosts whose differences synergized in such a way that empowered me to try and develop relationships with people who could engage me in the same way Wally & Andre did. A very prevalent sentiment Andre articulated was the idea that <em>truly</em> the majority of humans are unable to show their true selves. The way he articulated this was through the theater. He stated that we were all sort of performing and that we could never be close to nature or the Earth, that we have to cling on certain comforts. Wally counters this by saying that these comforts are necessary and even agrees with Andre by saying that these comforts do make it so mankind doesn''t have to process everything we see. When we see a bar, we only see a bar and not its history or all of what makes it. But, instead of seeing this as a negative (which is Andre's position) Wally sees this as a need for humans to keep up the quality of life they have right now. Even though the discussion as a whole was full of tangents and seemed to have no sort of direction, one thing I took from it was that it was <em>useful</em>. It''s useful to confront our existence as an individual and as a society, and a deep comfortability with another human is necessary to having a good life. Throughout the entire conversation, they were going back on forth and such intimate topics and they seemed to truly <em>enjoy</em> it. I think that''s what the movie was sort of trying to articulate, which is <em>that</em> everything is constructed but it''s constructed for good reason( blankets are used for heat etc). And that we should have those types of conversations, where we just step back and look at our life from a meta-lense. Which ultimately reminds us of the fact that we''re all just humans who have constructed society and our way of life to maximize our happiness, and that should be our goal. To achieve the closest feeling to true happiness. </p>
